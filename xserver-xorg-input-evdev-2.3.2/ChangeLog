    Fix up BTN_TOUCH handling for non-button tablets.
    
    BTN_TOOL_* is treated as tool, just like before. BTN_TOUCH on the other hand
    may need to be treated as a button left press. This again requires a button
    class.

    Swap axes before applying touch screen calibration.
    
    When the SwapAxes option is set, the X and Y axes in calibration should
    be labelled as the user perceives them -- not as the kernel sends them.
    
    Currently, we apply the X-axis calibration to the X-axis of the input,
    and then do the axis swapping so we've actually applied the X-axis
    calibration to what the user sees as the Y-axis.
    
    This patch changes the order of the operations, so that the axes are
    swapped before the calibration is applied.

    Set all valuators for relative motion events (#24737)
    
    We should process all the deltas reported by a relative motion device,
    otherwise some devices such as A4Tech X-750F or similar may trigger a
    situation when the `v` array contains random values (it isn't
    initialized anywhere) and later we process them and in effect the mouse
    cursor "jumps" on the screen.
    I'm not sure why, but we also must be sure that the `first` and `last`
    variables reflect the axis map, otherwise the mouse cursor "jumps" on
    the screen when clicking mouse buttons in some rare cases reported by
    Bartek Iwaniec on Bugzilla. That's why a simple initialization of the
    `v` array with zeros isn't sufficient.

    Relax checks when reopening devices
    
    When checking whether we are dealing with the same device as before
    when we try to reopen it evdev should not require exact match of
    entire keymap. Users should be allowed to adjust keymaps to better
    match their hardware even after X starts. However we don't expect
    changes in [BTN_MISC, KEY_OK) range since these codes are reserved for
    mice, joysticks, tablets and so forth, so we will limit the check to
    this range.
    
    The same goes for absinfo - limits can change and it should not result
    in device being disabled.
    
    Also check the length of the data returned by ioctl and don't try to
    compare more than we were given.

    Convert IgnoreAbsolute/RelativeAxes options into trinary state.
    
    The Xen Virtual Pointer device exports both absolute and relative axes from
    the kernel device. Which coordinates are used is a run-time decision and
    depends on the host-specific configuration.
    0a3657d2ee62f4086e9687218cb33835ba61a0b3 broke these devices, and they are
    now unusable out-of-the-box as there is no configuration to cover them.
    
    This patch converts the IgnoreAbsoluteAxes and the IgnoreRelativeAxes
    configuration options into a trinary state.
    1. If unset, configure the device as normal by trying to guess the right
       axis setup.
    2. If set to true, ignore the specific axis type completely (except for
       wheel events).
    3. If set to false, explicitly 'unignore' the axis type, alwas configuring
       it if it is present on the device. This setting introduces seemingly
       buggy behaviour (see Bug 21832)
    
    1. and 2. replicate the current driver behaviour.
    The result of 3. is that is that if a device has absolute axes and the
    options set to false, both axes will be initialized (absolute last to get
    clipping right). This requires axis labelling priorty to switch from
    relative first to absolute first.
    
    Relative events are forwarded into the server through the absolute axes,
    the server scales this into the device absolute range and everyone is happy.

    Add explicit options to ignore relative or absolute axes.
    
    The X server cannot deal with devices that have both relative and absolute
    axes. Evdev tries to guess wich axes to ignore given the device type and
    disables absolute axes for mice and relative axes for tablets, touchscreens
    and touchpad. This guess is sometimes wrong and causes exitus felis
    domesticae parvulae.
    
    Two new configuration options are provided to explicitly allow ignoring an
    axis. Mouse wheel axes are exempt and will work even if relative axes are
    ignored.  No property, this option must be set in the configuration.

    Only take the driver-internal button mapping to count buttons (#23405)
    
    Regression:
        If a user has multiple buttons mapped to the same button number, the
        number of buttons counted is set to a wrong value.  e.g. a button
        mapping of 1 1 1 for a mouse with three buttons would only initialize 1
        button to the X server.
    
        In the future, the user cannot change this button mapping as the server
        only knows about one button.
    
    The user-supplied button map (option ButtonMapping) shouldn't matter when
    counting the buttons. Only the driver-internal mapping (BTN_0 -> button 1,
    etc.) matters.

    Restrict wheel emulation to a single axis at a time.
    
    Wheel emulation works for both horizontal and vertical axes. Thus, if a
    device doesn't move in perfect straight line, scroll events build up on the
    respective other axis.
    
    In some clients, scroll wheel events have specific meanings other than
    scrolling (e.g. mplayer). In these clients, erroneous scrolling events come
    at a high cost.
    
    Thus, if a scroll wheel event is generated for one axis, reset the inertia
    of the other axis to 0, avoiding the buildup of these erroneous scrolling
    events.

    Add EvdevPostButtonEvent API to immediately post a button event (#23269)
    
    The wheel emulation code needs this API. When the timer expires, the event
    must be posted immediately, not enqueued onto the internal event queue.
    Otherwise, the emulated middle button press is enqueued only and no event is
    sent until the next physical event (and its EV_SYN) arrives.
    
    Since the timer is triggered outside of the SIGIO and SIGIO is blocked
    during this period anyway, we could also just enqueue the event and flush by
    simulating an EV_SYN. It's easier this way though.

    evdev.c: Fix/improve discrimination of rel/abs axes
    
    The relevant comment from evdev.c:
    
    We don't allow relative and absolute axes on the same device. The
    reason is that some devices (MS Optical Desktop 2000) register both
    rel and abs axes for x/y.
    
    The abs axes register min/max; this min/max then also applies to the
    relative device (the mouse) and caps it at 0..255 for both axes.
    So, unless you have a small screen, you won't be enjoying it much;
    consequently, absolute axes are generally ignored.
    
    However, currenly only a device with absolute axes can be registered
    as a touch{pad,screen}. Thus, given such a device, absolute axes are
    used and relative axes are ignored.
    
    The code for initializing abs/rel axes has been abstracted out into
    3 functions, so that initialization in EvdevInit(device) is as easy
    as:
    
        if (pEvdev->flags & (EVDEV_TOUCHPAD | EVDEV_TOUCHSCREEN))
            EvdevInitTouchDevice(device, pEvdev);
        else if (pEvdev->flags & EVDEV_RELATIVE_EVENTS)
            EvdevInitRelClass(device, pEvdev);
        else if (pEvdev->flags & EVDEV_ABSOLUTE_EVENTS)
            EvdevInitAbsClass(device, pEvdev);

    evdev: Use the EvdevPost...Event() functions in the emulation code.
    
    This is similar to commit 1f641d75edba7394201c1c53938215bae696791b.
    
    It provides the same functionality of queuing the (in this case
    emulated) events and waiting until an EV_SYN synchronization event is
    received before posting them to the server.
    
    This preserves the order of events (both real and emulated) and ensures
    that MotionNotify events will always be posted first. It also unifies
    the event posting into a few small functions which improves
    maintainability.
    
    From this point on, you should never use the xf86Post...Event()
    functions in new code, but rather the EvdevPost...Event() versions.

    evdev: Only send the events at synchronization time.
    
    Instead of just posting the button/key press/release events to the
    server as soon as they arrive, add them to an internal queue and post
    them once we receive an EV_SYN synchronization event.
    
    The motion events are always sent first, followed by the queued events.
    There will be one motion event and possibly many queued button/key
    events posted every EV_SYN event.
    
    Note that the size of the event queue (EVDEV_MAXQUEUE) is arbitrary and
    you may change it. If we receive more events than the queue can handle,
    those events are dropped and a warning message printed.
    
    Tested on my Lenovo T400 using evdev for all input devices; keyboard,
    touchpad, and trackpoint.

    88eedea281a710008a82f1e6af4bdffd19477f46 added axis labelling to the

    The current implementation initializes itself to support relative

    Ensure enough buttons are advertised to pass the button mapping.
    
    Some buttons are mapped to higher button numbers. For example, BTN_0 is
    posted as button 8 if BTN_LEFT is present. On top of that, the
    driver-specific button mapping may map the button to something else again.
    We need to take these mappings into account when counting the number of
    buttons on the device.
    
    Example: A device with BTN_LEFT and BTN_0 and a mapping from 1 -> 7 and 8 ->
    2.
    
    BTN_LEFT is mapped to 1. 1 is mapped to 7. num_buttons is 7.
    BTN_0 is mapped to 8. 8 is mapped to 2. num_buttons remains 7.

    Potential memory smash if a device had a BTN_LEFT and BTN_0, since the

    If scrollwheels are found, bump the button number by 4 (or up to 7).
    
    Scrollwheel data is always posted as buttons, so we need to advertise at least
    enough buttons to accommodate for 6/7 (horizontal wheel).
    
    Note that this may mean that if you have a device that has scroll wheels and
    axes, but no buttons, it may be interpreted as a mouse.

    Open with O_NONBLOCK, and simplify EvdevReadInput to match.
    
    xf86WaitForInput() would call select() with zero timeout to discover if
    more input was ready.  But we know that's always true at least once,
    since we're only ever called from the sigio handler (if silken is
    active) or from the main loop (if it's not and we selected readable).
    With nonblocking IO we can just spin around until we hit EAGAIN, which
    gets us down to n+1 syscalls per event instead of 2n.

    Input devices (especially touchscreens) were disabled when switching
    virtual console back to X because EvdevCacheCompare() thought the device
    was substituted by another while away from X. Actually only the current
    position reported by the device changed from what was in the cache. Fixed

    Fix FOO_MAX off-by-one
    
    In linux/input.h each section's (e.g. ABS) FOO_MAX is the maximum FOO
    value. Recent kernels define FOO_CNT as the maximum number of FOO there
    will ever be. Hence using FOO_MAX to size the bit vectors representing
    the capabilities of an evdev device is off by one.
    
    Define FOO_CNT values for use with Linux kernels which lack them. Use
    FOO_CNT whenever we need to know the number of bits needed -- usually to
    calculate the number of longs needed.
    
    When iterating over the values FOO_MAX still seems appropriate however
    the loop test should include FOO_MAX rather than skip it.

    Support keyboards with scroll wheels.
    
    For keyboards, scroll events are reported by the kernel as EV_REL class events
    of REL_WHEEL type. If, during probing, the device is found to support wheel
    events, make sure it is set up as a pointing device, even if it doesn't have
    buttons or doesn't report motion along the X and Y axis so that the scroll
    events can be mapped to mouse wheel buttons (usually buttons 4 and 5).

    Add support for run-time calibration.
    
    Some devices require run-time axis calibration. We can't change the min/max
    ranges once we've initialised the valuator structs though, so in-driver
    run-time calibration is required.
    
    If the property is set, the driver scales from the calibrated range to the
    values reported to the X server (which then may scale to screen coordinates).
    If the property is not set (i.e. zero items) no scaling is performed.

    Close fd on DEVICE_OFF. (LP #276887)
    
    Leaving the fd open means we still get keyboard events after VT switching
    away. Coming back, some of these events are replayed on the application that
    has the current focus.
    
    Reproduceable:
    1. open terminal, focus.
    2. VT switch away
    3. type something, preferably a password
    4. VT switch back, trigger a mouse event
    5. Observe the X server guessing your password.
    
    Closing the fd on DEVICE_OFF fixes this. Reopen is handled by the reopen
    code introduced with

    Register property handlers directly, instead of abstracting them.
    
    This removes a left-over from the early device property code where we could
    only have a single handler. Now it's easier to just register the handlers for
    each subsystem (emulate wheel, draglock and MB emulation).

    Attempt to re-open devices on read errors.
    
    Coming back from resume may leave us with a file descriptor that can be opened
    but fails on the first read (ENODEV).
    In this case, try to open the device until it becomes available or until the
    predefined count expires. To be safe, we cache the information from the device
    and compare against it when we re-open. This way we ensure that if the
    topology changes under us, we don't open a completely different device. If a
    device has changed, we disable it.
    
    Adds option "ReopenAttempts" <int>

    The commit b4a5a204 fixed an issue, where we can't move the pointer to
    other screens and this happens in current master branch again. This commit
    ports the old commit to the current master branch.

    Fail if the device cannot be grabbed during the probe.
    
    If the grab fails, this is most likely a sign that the device has been grabbed
    already (probably by a device specified in xorg.conf). So let's not add the
    device to the server's input device list, since it won't generate events
    anyway.
    
    Exception: keyboards and kernel 2.4 are not affected.

    In the mouse driver, these options are only used if XFree86LOADER is
    undefined. configure.ac in the xserver forces said define to 1 if we're
    building the xfree86 DDX, so I don't see the point of having them around.
    Especially since they weren't used in evdev anyway.

    Don't allow relative and absolute axes on the same device.
    
    This is a bit of a mess. The MS Optical Desktop 2000 registers both relative
    and absolute axes on the same device (the mouse). The absolute axes have a
    valid min/max range for x/y and thus overwrite the x/y relative axes in the
    server (no, this is not a server bug). And I wouldn't be surprised if other
    devices have similar issues.
    
    Since the device only sends relative events after that, the mouse is
    essentially restricted to the min..max range of 0..255. The server simply
    doesn't do unrestricted relative axis and restricted absolute axis on the same
    device (not for the same axis numbers anyway).

    Not many mice do this, but some do, Apple Mighty Mouse in particular, and
    it makes click-and-drag pretty much impossible to use.
    
    Arguably we should filter _all_ repeat events from the kernel and handle
    synthesizing them in the server.

    Add absolute coordinate event support.
    
    There are two major classes here, touchscreens and touchpads.  Touchpads
    are logically more like relative devices, in that your initial touch
    should not warp the cursor.  So attempt to detect touchpads (via the
    existence of BTN_TOUCH) and translate absolute events from those devices
    to relative motion.

    xorg-server won't generate soft autorepeat, when interval/delay are at default of 40/660 (see xkb/ddxCtrls.c:
    XkbDDXUsesSoftRepeat). When we hit the defaults, we let the kernel autorepeat pass, if we differ, we swallow them all
    and let the server figure out autorepeat in software.

    Clear EV_ABS_V_USE_TOUCH for devices without a touch button
    
    VMware's absolute pointing device does not have a pressure/touch button.
    Although evdev correctly recognizes this, it sets "use_touch" for X and Y axes
    regardless of the touch button. This patch clears the USE_TOUCH flag for the X
    and Y axes if the device does not have a touch button.

        If it's a chain, it still has a string, but the chain pointer is set.
    
        EvdevParseMapToButton, EvdevParseMapToButtons, and EvdevParseMapOption.
    
    evdev_axes.c:
    
        Kill off EvdevAxesMapButton, a variant lives in evdev_btn.c now.
    
        Changes for the evdev_option_token_t changes.
    
        Use EvdevParseMapOption instead of repeating the contents twice.
    
        Disable EV_ABS_V_INVERT for the moment. (Better fix maybe needed.)
    
    evdev_btn.c:
    
        s/Ptr /Rec */g
    
        EvdevMapButton and parser.

commit 294355842ba9fb3cb3bbd7bfd60c9ca3ce704475
Author: Zephaniah E. Hull <warp@agamemnon.b5>
Date:   Tue Jun 5 23:12:58 2007 -0400

    Alright, this is a really big commit that breaks stuff.
    
    evdev.h:
    
        Switch to flags in the abs and rel structs.
    
        Add the axes struct, and defines.
    
        Rework the abs and rel structs, moving stuff to the axes struct and moving
        everything to the new mapping handling.
    
        Add the structs and function declarations for the new tokenization stuff,
        parsing stuff, and mapping stuff.
    
    evdev.c: Add EvdevTokenize, and the evdev_map_parsers list.
    
    evdev_axes.c:
    
        Basicly a full rewrite, big, messy.
    
        We now use a completely different mapping setup for axes, and mapping to
        buttons is currently missing.
    
        However we now handle ABS_CALIB and ABS_AREA, including rotation in both
        rel and abs modes.
    
    evdev_btn.c:
    
        Disable lots of code and break things horribly, we compile but we don't
        work very well.
    
        Fixing this is next on my todo list.

    map always covers up to 255.  This ensures that the keycode range never
    changes.

    Split the New functions so that structs can be allocated and buttons
    detected, and then stuff that depends on _other_ areas.
    (Specificly, axes and btn have a circular dependency on which one has to
    run first, this solves that.)
    
    Add button names, and a way to get a button number from a name.
    
    Add a function for checking to see if a button exists, takes the number from the previous function.
    
    Change the (unused) state array of pointers in the button struct to an array of pointers to functions for callback.
    
    Implemented the 'touch' feature, on by default if BTN_DIGI_TOUCH exists,
    won't, in rel mode, process x/y data unless it's down, and is used to
    try and make 'pick up stencil, move to other side of digitizer, set back
    down' not jump to the other side of the screen in rel mode.
    (This doesn't work as well as it could, but I'm fairly sure that it's
    due to the quality of the absolute input device I'm using, but feedback
    would be really nice.)

    evdevAbsRec: Remove the scale bool, rename scale_x and scale_y to scale[2].
        evdevAxesRec: Make btnMap an int array instead of a Card8 array.
    Make abs support and non-core stuff actually work.
    Relative emulation for abs mode is still a bit broken, but that's far less
        critical.
    How many buttons we've registered is configuration information, not an
        error message.

    Remove a debugging message.
    Actually, well, _work_. Note, abs support still segfaults, I'll debug it
        after I've slept. But I should get it tomorrow.

    Remove evdev_abs.c and evdev_rel.c. Added evdev_axes.c.
    Change the calls to refer to EvdevAxes instead of Abs and Rel. Include
        mipointer.h. (Fixes a compile error.) Remove an unused variable from
        EvdevReadInput.
    Removed evdev_abs.c and evdev_rel.c, added evdev_axes.c. Added count to rel
        and abs. Moved btnMap from rel to the new axes. Shuffle some includes,
        and include stdarg.h.
    Removed.
    New, a mix of rel and abs that should actually work in the rel case.
    Rearrange include order. btnMap was moved from being part of rel to being
        part of axes.
    Removed.
    Rearrange include order.
    Rearrange include order.
    NOTE: This commit has been compile tested, not run tested.
    I have some other changes to make before I can do more heavy testing.

    Compile with -Wall now. Add evdev.h to the sources so that make distcheck
        gets it.
    Bugzilla #5943 <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi=5943> Make sure
        we include errno.h.
    Reduce EVDEV_MAXBUTTONS to 96.
    Split up evdevStateRec into a struct with pointers to new structs for btn,
        abs, rel, and key.
    New structure type for handling the device capability bitmaps.
    Add device bits and struct input_id to evdevDeviceRec.
    Add matching device bits, struct input_id, and pass number to
        evdevDriverRec.
    Prototype for evdevGetBits from evdev_brain.c.
    Conversion for the evdevStateRec split.
    Remove the errno.h include, it's in evdev.h for now.
    Move the bit getting from the drivers to here, into evdevDeviceRec.
    Fix a rare case of fd leakage.
    Add several new (and somewhat ugly) device matching options: <map>Bits:
        Where map is one of ev, key, rel, abs, msc, led, snd, or ff. In the
        format of '+0 +3 -1-2 ~5-10', requires bits 0 and 3 be set, bits 1 and
        2 to not be set, and at least one bit in the range of 5 to
    10 be set. bustype, vendor, product, and version: Simple integer options
        for matching the struct device_id fields, must be 0 (the default) or
        the exact value you wish to match against. pass: Bounded to 0-3,
        devices are matched to the first matching entry found, order for
        multiple matching entries in the same pass is undefined, but it starts
        with pass 0 and goes to pass 3.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Add evdevGetBits to fill the new evdevBitsRec struct type.
    Lots of somewhat ugly code for matching by capability bits.
    Split out of evdevRescanDevices to smaller handling functions. The new
        design should be better if I decide to handle arbitrary Device fields
        again.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Handle all buttons, no button compression at this time, however we reorder
        things so that BTN_MOUSE comes before BTN_MISC, somewhat evily.
    Support for the new btn->state[] array of int pointers.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    I really hope I didn't miss any changes.

        updated version of the patch listed. Basicly a rewrite of the driver,

        basic absolute pointer support. Lots more, will require some user
        config changes.
